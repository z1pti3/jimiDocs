# Actions

Actions within jimi are the building blocks of automation and enable jimi to do things when called by a trigger.

Actions needs to be connected from either another action or from a trigger.

For connecting actions and triggers, see https://z1pti3.github.io/jimiDocs/System/Conducts.html#link-objects

Actions work a lot like programs on a computer. You execute them and they return success or failure along with a return code which can be used to control what happens next in your jimiFlow
